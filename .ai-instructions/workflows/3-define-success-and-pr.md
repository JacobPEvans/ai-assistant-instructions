# Step 3: Define Success and Create Pull Request

**Goal:** Create tests that define success and get approval on the plan.

## Rules

- **Only Create New Tests.** You must not modify any existing code or tests.
- **Tests Must Fail.** The new tests you create should fail because the implementation code does not exist yet.
- **Do Not Mock.** Do not use mock data or fake results in tests. Tests must reflect real-world usage.

## Tasks

1. **Write Tests.**
    1.1. Based on the plan from Step 2, write new test files.
    1.2. The tests must cover all the requirements of the plan.
    1.3. The tests must check for the expected output and behavior.

2. **Verify Tests Fail.**
    2.1. Run the testing tool for the project.
    2.2. Confirm that the new tests fail as expected.
    2.3. Confirm that all existing tests still pass.

3. **Commit and Create Pull Request.**
    3.1. Stage and commit **only the new test files**.
    3.2. The commit message must be clear and follow project standards.
    3.3. Create a new pull request (PR).
    3.4. The PR description must contain:
        3.4.1. A link to the PRD file created in Step 2.
        3.4.2. A clear summary of the PRD's "Objective" and "Success Metrics".

4. **Wait for Approval.**
    4.1. Do not move to Step 4 until the PR has been reviewed and approved. This is a mandatory stop.
    
**⚠️ NOTE:** PR conversation resolution may require manual intervention as the automated system is a work in progress.
