# Step 1: Research and Explore

**Goal**: Understand the task completely before starting any work. This phase is about gathering information, defining the scope, and identifying potential
challenges.

## Rules

- **Do Not Change Files**: You must not change or delete any files in this step.
- **Read Only**: This step is for reading and learning only.

## Key Activities

1. **Analyze the Request**:
    1.1. Read the user's request carefully.
    1.2. Identify the main goal, the "start state," and the desired "end state."
    1.3. **Prompt**: "My goal is to [describe the feature or fix]. What is the best way to approach this, keeping our [tech stack and patterns] in mind?"

2. **Explore the Codebase**:
    2.1. Use file system and search tools to find relevant files, functions, and components.
    2.2. Read the contents of the files to understand the existing code style, patterns, and libraries.
    2.3. **Prompt**: "I need to implement [feature]. Based on the `memory-bank`, what are the key files I need to modify?"

3. **Identify Risks and Dependencies**:
    3.1. Analyze the potential impact of the changes.
    3.2. **Prompt**: "What are the potential risks or side effects of modifying these files? Are there any dependencies I should be aware of?"

4. **Confirm Understanding**:
    4.1. If the request is unclear, ask the user questions to clarify.
    4.2. Do not move to Step 2 until the goal is understood.
