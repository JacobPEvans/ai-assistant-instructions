## Example Review Comment

> ğŸŸ¡ **Suggested** (Code Quality):
>
> The function `process_data()` on line 72 seems to be doing multiple things.
> We should consider breaking it into smaller functions for better testability and readability.
>
> It could be split into:
>
> - `validate_data()`
> - `transform_data()`
> - `save_data()`
