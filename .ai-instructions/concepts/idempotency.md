# Concept: Idempotency

Idempotency ensures operations can be repeated multiple times with consistent results.

## Definition

An idempotent operation produces the same result regardless of how many times it's executed.

## Applications

### Code Operations
- API endpoints return same response for identical requests
- Database migrations create consistent state
- Function calls with same parameters yield identical outputs

### Infrastructure
- Terraform/Terragrunt deployments reach same end state
- Configuration management tools maintain desired state
- Container deployments produce identical environments

### AI Workflows
- Same prompts generate consistent outputs when possible
- Workflow steps can be re-run safely
- Documentation updates don't break existing references

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: Operations can be safely retried
- **Debugging**: Reproducible behavior aids troubleshooting  
- **Automation**: Safe for automated systems and CI/CD
- **Recovery**: Failed operations can be resumed safely
