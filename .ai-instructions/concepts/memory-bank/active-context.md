# Active Context

This document is the "current memory" of the AI. It tracks the immediate task at hand, the files involved, and the next step.
It should be updated at the end of every session.

## Purpose

To provide the AI with a snapshot of the current work, allowing it to instantly resume a task without needing to re-read the entire project history.

## Session Management

- **End of Session**: "Please update `active-context.md` to summarize our work and outline the next steps."
- **Start of Session**: "Let's continue. Please read the `memory-bank/` folder to understand the current project state."

## Example

**Current Task**: Refactoring the `README.md` to include a new "Quick Start" section.

**Files Involved**:

- `README.md`
- `.ai-instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Next Step**:

- Verify the links in the new "Quick Start" section are correct.
- Commit the changes with a standardized commit message.
