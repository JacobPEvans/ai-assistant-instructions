# Concept: The Memory Bank

A set of documents that provide structured project context to AI assistants.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank provides a persistent knowledge base about the project, enabling:

- **Consistency**: Work remains aligned with project goals and standards
- **Efficiency**: Reduces repetitive context-setting
- **Scalability**: Handles growing project complexity
- **Collaboration**: Enables handoffs between AI assistants and developers

## Core Components

- **[Project Brief](./project-brief.md)**: A one-sentence description of the project.
- **[Technical Context](./technical-context.md)**: The tech stack, libraries, and versions.
- **[System Patterns](./system-patterns.md)**: The architecture and design patterns.
- **[Active Context](./active-context.md)**: The "current memory" of what is being worked on right now.
- **[Progress Tracking](./progress-tracking.md)**: The overall project progress and what is complete.
