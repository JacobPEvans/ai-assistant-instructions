# Concept: Documentation Standards

This document outlines the universal standards for writing clear and effective documentation.

## General Principles

- **Clarity**: Write for a US middle/high school reading level.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure documentation is always up-to-date with the code.
- **Completeness**: Include setup instructions, configuration options, and working examples.

## Formatting

- **Markdown**: Use standard Markdown syntax.
- **Code Blocks**: Use proper syntax highlighting for all code examples.
- **Linking**: Link to other relevant documents instead of repeating information, following the [DRY Principle](./dry-principle.md).
- **Hierarchical Numbering**: Use nested numbers (e.g., 1., 1.1., 1.1.1.) for lists. This gives AI agents a clear, trackable structure to follow.
  When possible, implement workflows as steps with tasks and subtasks.
- **Conciseness**: Keep documentation as short as possible while still conveying all critical information. These files are for AI first, humans second.
