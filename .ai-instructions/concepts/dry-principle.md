# The DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

The DRY principle is a fundamental concept in software development that promotes reducing the repetition of information of all kinds.

## In Code

- **Functions and Classes**: Encapsulate reusable logic into functions or classes. Instead of writing the same code block multiple times, call the function.
- **Constants and Configuration**: Store values that are used in multiple places as constants or in configuration files.

## In Documentation

The DRY principle applies to documentation as well.

- **Single Source of Truth**: There should be one, and only one, authoritative source for any piece of information.
- **Linking**: Instead of repeating information, link to the single source of truth. This ensures that when the information is updated in one place, all references to it remain correct.
- **Templates**: Use templates for recurring document structures (e.g., pull request descriptions).

Adhering to the DRY principle makes code and documentation more maintainable, less error-prone, and easier to understand.
