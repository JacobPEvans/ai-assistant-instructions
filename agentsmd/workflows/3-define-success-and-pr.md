# Step 3: Define Success and Create Pull Request

**Goal:** Create tests that define success and get approval on the plan.

## Rules

- **Only Create New Tests.** Do not modify any existing code or tests.
- **Tests Must Fail.** The new tests should fail because the implementation code does not exist yet.
- **Do Not Mock.** Tests must reflect real-world usage.

## Tasks

1. **Write Tests** based on the plan from Step 2 covering all requirements.
2. **Verify Tests Fail** as expected and all existing tests still pass.
3. **Commit and Create Pull Request** with only the new test files. The PR description must contain:
   - A link to the PRD file created in Step 2.
   - A clear summary of the PRD's "Objective" and "Success Metrics".
4. **Wait for Approval** before moving to Step 4. This is a mandatory stop.
