# Step 2: Plan and Document (as a PRD)

**Goal:** Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) that is final for this cycle.

## Rules

- **Do Not Change Project Files.** You must not change project code or documentation yet.
- **Create a PRD File.** Create a new file named `.tmp/prd-<task-name>.md`.
- **Checklist-Driven Plan**: The `Implementation Plan` must be a Markdown checklist.

## PRD Required Sections

1. **Objective:** What is the high-level goal? What user problem are we solving?
2. **Success Metrics:** How will we measure success? What is the expected, measurable outcome?
3. **Requirements:** Use a numbered list to define the specific functional requirements.
4. **Out of Scope:** What are we explicitly *not* doing?
5. **Implementation Plan:** A detailed, step-by-step technical plan. This must be a checklist.
6. **Risks:** What could go wrong?

## Finalize

This PRD is now **locked**. It cannot be changed. If the PRD is wrong, the entire 5-step process must fail and restart from Step 1.
