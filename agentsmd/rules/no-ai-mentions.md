# No AI Mentions in PR Comments

## Rule

**NEVER tag AI assistants in PR comments unless explicitly requesting assistance.**

Examples: @gemini-code-assist, @copilot, etc.

## Problem Statement

Tagging AI assistants in PR comments creates unnecessary notifications and clutters
the discussion thread. AIs don't need to be notified about fixes - they will see
resolved threads when they review the PR again.

## Guidelines

### When to Use @ Mentions

Only use @ mentions to explicitly request something:

```markdown
@gemini-code-assist review the security implications of this change
```

### When NOT to Use @ Mentions

Never use @ mentions for these purposes:

- ❌ Acknowledging that you implemented a fix

  ```markdown
  ✅ @gemini-code-assist Fixed in commit 04f7f66
  ```

  Instead: Just resolve the thread without tagging

- ❌ Notifying the AI that you've addressed feedback

  ```markdown
  @gemini-code-assist Updated the function signature as suggested
  ```

  Instead: Make the change and resolve the thread

- ❌ Thanking the AI for feedback

  ```markdown
  Thanks @gemini-code-assist for the suggestion
  ```

  Instead: Just resolve the thread normally

## Implementation

### For Skills and Commands

When responding to AI-generated review comments:

1. **Implement the fix** if accepting the suggestion
2. **Commit the change** with descriptive message
3. **Resolve the thread** without tagging the AI
4. **Do NOT include any @ mention** in your reply

Template for thread resolution:

```markdown
Fixed in commit [HASH]. [Brief explanation of change if needed].
```

### For Marketplace Skills (e.g., Gemini Code Assist)

Marketplace skills can't be modified directly, but the AIs using them (Claude, Gemini, etc.) must follow this rule in their responses.

**This rule is part of the system instructions** and applies to all AI assistants operating in this repository, including:

- Claude Code (via system prompt)
- Gemini Code Assist users (via this rule documentation)
- Any other AI tool generating PR comments

## Rationale

1. **No Interaction Needed**: AIs don't require notifications to function
2. **Cleaner Discussion**: Threads are easier to follow without unnecessary tags
3. **Prevents Cascading Tags**: Avoids creating chains of AI-to-AI mentions
4. **Respects PR History**: When reviewing past PRs, clean threads are more useful
5. **Professional Standards**: Tags are for humans who need to respond; AIs will review resolved threads

## Exceptions

The ONLY exception to this rule is explicit requests for assistance:

```markdown
@gemini-code-assist Can you review the performance implications of this refactoring?
```

This is appropriate because it's a request for action.
