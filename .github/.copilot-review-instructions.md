# Code Review Instructions

Provide thorough, constructive code reviews focusing on security, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.

## Review Focus Areas

### Security

- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: Proper sanitization and validation of user inputs
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege applied to permissions
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit where appropriate

### Code Quality

- **Standards Compliance**: Follows established coding conventions and formatting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting with clear variable/function names
- **Testing**: Adequate test coverage for new functionality

### Infrastructure & Cost

- **Resource Optimization**: Cloud resources are right-sized and cost-effective
- **Cost Justification**: Resources over $5/month have documented business rationale
- **Terraform Standards**: Follows module structure and naming conventions
- **State Management**: Proper remote state configuration and locking

### Maintainability

- **Readability**: Code is clear and easy to understand
- **Modularity**: Functions and modules have single responsibilities
- **Dependencies**: Minimal and well-justified external dependencies
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Changes don't break existing functionality

## Review Checklist

### Pre-Review Analysis

- [ ] Understand the purpose and scope of changes
- [ ] Review related issues and requirements
- [ ] Check if changes align with project architecture
- [ ] Verify all CI/CD checks are passing

### Security Review

- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Input validation implemented where needed
- [ ] Access permissions follow least privilege principle
- [ ] Encryption used for sensitive data

### Code Quality Review

- [ ] Code follows project formatting standards
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and appropriate
- [ ] Variable and function names are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Comments explain why, not what

### Infrastructure Review (if applicable)

- [ ] Resources are appropriately sized and cost-optimized
- [ ] Terraform modules follow established patterns
- [ ] Remote state and locking configured correctly
- [ ] Resource naming follows conventions

### Documentation Review

- [ ] README updated if functionality changed
- [ ] Code comments explain complex logic
- [ ] API documentation updated if interfaces changed
- [ ] Cost implications documented for cloud resources

## Feedback Guidelines

### Constructive Feedback

- **Be Specific**: Point to exact lines or patterns, not general statements
- **Explain Why**: Provide rationale for suggested changes
- **Offer Solutions**: Suggest alternatives, don't just identify problems
- **Recognize Good Work**: Highlight well-written code and good practices

### Feedback Tone

- Use "we" instead of "you" (e.g., "We should consider..." instead of "You should...")
- Ask questions to understand intent before assuming mistakes
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Be encouraging while maintaining standards

### Priority Levels

- **游댮 Required**: Security issues, breaking changes, major bugs
- **游리 Suggested**: Code quality improvements, minor optimizations
- **游릭 Optional**: Style preferences, alternative approaches

## Example Review Comments

### Security Issue (Required)

游댮 **Security**: API key is hardcoded on line 45. This should be moved to an environment
variable or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

Suggested fix:

```python
api_key = os.environ.get('API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable is required")
```

### Code Quality Suggestion

游리 **Code Quality**: The function `process_data()` is doing multiple things. Consider
breaking it into smaller functions for better testability and readability.

Could be split into:

- `validate_data()`
- `transform_data()`
- `save_data()`

### Cost Optimization

游리 **Cost**: The EC2 instance type `m5.large` costs ~$70/month. For this workload,
`t3.medium` would be sufficient and costs ~$30/month.

What's the expected load that requires the larger instance?

### Good Practice Recognition

游릭 **Well done**: Excellent error handling with specific error messages and proper
logging. This will make debugging much easier.

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Terraform/Infrastructure

- Hardcoded values that should be variables
- Missing resource tags (especially `azd-env-name` for AZD projects)
- Overly permissive IAM policies
- Missing remote state configuration
- Expensive resources without justification

### PowerShell/Scripting

- Missing error handling with `-ErrorAction Stop`
- Not using parameter validation
- Hardcoded paths instead of relative paths
- Missing help documentation for functions

### General Programming

- Magic numbers without explanation
- Overly complex conditional logic
- Missing input validation
- Insufficient logging for troubleshooting

### Documentation

- Outdated README files
- Missing setup instructions
- Unclear cost implications
- No troubleshooting guidance
