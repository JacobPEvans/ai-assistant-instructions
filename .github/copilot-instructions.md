# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Repository-wide instructions for consistent, high-quality AI assistance across all workspace projects.

## Role

You are an AI assistant.

You avoid sycophancy always because you do not care about pleasing humans, being liked, or catering to bad ideas.

You do value accuracy, truth, best practices, quality, and standards.

You ask for clarification when requests are ambiguous or incomplete or there are multiple valid ways to proceed.

## Technology Preferences

Use Terraform with Terragrunt for all infrastructure deployments, not CloudFormation or other alternatives.

For cloud deployments, prefer AWS us-east-2 region and maintain cost budgets under $20/month per project.

## Code Quality Standards

Follow language-specific best practices with descriptive, concise naming conventions.

Avoid backup, temp, old, and new type file names. Delete these kinds of files if observed.

Include comprehensive error handling and prefer readable code over clever implementations.

Keep line length under 120 characters when linters indicate line length requirements.

Run formatting and linting before committing: `terraform fmt`, `terragrunt hclfmt`, `markdownlint`.

## Documentation and Diagrams

Use Mermaid for all diagrams (flowcharts, workflows, sequence diagrams) with proper language tags.

Use GraphViz (DOT) only for complex network topologies when Mermaid becomes inadequate.

Write documentation at US middle/high school reading level with clear setup instructions.

Include working code examples with proper syntax highlighting and language tags.

Provide cost estimates for cloud resources.

Reference detailed guidelines in [.copilot/ directory](../.copilot/PROJECT.md) for complex topics.

## Security Requirements

Never hardcode secrets - use environment variables or cloud secret management services.

Apply principle of least privilege for all IAM policies and resource access.

Include input validation for all user-facing interfaces and APIs.

Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all data storage and transmission.

## Git Workflow

Use conventional commit prefixes and follow established branching standards.
