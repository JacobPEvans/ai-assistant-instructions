# Code Generation Instructions

Generate high-quality, maintainable code following established project standards and best practices.

## General Principles

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow language-specific conventions and formatting rules
- Use descriptive, concise naming for variables, functions, and classes
- Prefer readable code over clever implementations
- Include comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- Keep line length under 120 characters when linters indicate requirements

### Documentation Requirements

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable/function names
- Include comments to explain why, not what
- Provide working code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Document cost implications for cloud resources
- Include setup and usage instructions

### Security Best Practices

- Never hardcode secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
- Use environment variables or cloud secret management services
- Apply principle of least privilege for all permissions and access
- Include input validation for user-facing interfaces
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit for data storage

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Terragrunt)

- Use variables instead of hardcoded values
- Include resource tags (especially `azd-env-name` for AZD projects)
- Follow module structure and naming conventions
- Configure remote state with locking
- Estimate and document costs for resources over $5/month

### PowerShell Scripting

- Use parameter validation and error handling with `-ErrorAction Stop`
- Include help documentation for functions
- Use relative paths instead of hardcoded paths
- Follow verb-noun naming convention for functions
- Include comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Python Development

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Include docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Include requirements.txt with pinned versions

### Cloud Development (AWS)

- Prefer AWS us-east-2 region for cost optimization
- Use cost-optimized instance types and services
- Implement proper IAM roles with least privilege
- Include monitoring and alerting for critical resources
- Document monthly cost estimates

## Project Structure Standards

### File Organization

- Avoid backup, temp, old, and new type file names
- Use clear, descriptive directory structures
- Include .gitignore for temporary files and secrets
- Organize code into logical modules and components

### Version Control

- Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Include meaningful commit messages with context
- Reference related issues in commits and pull requests

## Error Handling and Logging

### Error Handling Patterns

- Handle expected errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Use appropriate error types and status codes
- Include retry logic for transient failures

### Logging Best Practices

- Use structured logging with consistent formats
- Include relevant context (user ID, request ID, etc.)
- Log at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Avoid logging sensitive information

## Performance and Optimization

### General Performance

- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Consider resource usage and scalability

### Cloud Resource Optimization

- Right-size instances and services
- Use auto-scaling and spot instances where appropriate
- Implement cost monitoring and alerting
- Clean up unused resources regularly

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Requirements

- Include unit tests for core functionality
- Provide integration tests for external dependencies
- Include example usage and validation steps
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Code Validation

- Run formatters and linters before committing
- Validate configuration files and templates
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify documentation accuracy

## Examples and Templates

### Terraform Module Example

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name (dev, staging, prod)"
  type        = string
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "${var.environment}-example-bucket-${random_id.suffix.hex}"

  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.environment}-example-bucket"
    Environment = var.environment
    azd-env-name = var.environment
  }
}

# Estimated cost: ~$5/month for standard storage
```

### PowerShell Function Example

```powershell
function Invoke-BackupOperation {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Performs backup operation with error handling and logging.

    .PARAMETER SourcePath
    Path to source directory to backup

    .PARAMETER DestinationPath
    Path to destination for backup files
    #>
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [ValidateScript({Test-Path $_ -PathType Container})]
        [string]$SourcePath,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$DestinationPath
    )

    try {
        Write-Information "Starting backup from $SourcePath to $DestinationPath"

        # Backup logic here
        Copy-Item -Path $SourcePath -Destination $DestinationPath -Recurse -ErrorAction Stop

        Write-Information "Backup completed successfully"
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Backup failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        throw
    }
}
```

### Python Class Example

```python
import os
import logging
from typing import Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DatabaseConfig:
    """Configuration for database connection."""
    host: str
    port: int
    database: str
    username: str
    password: str

class DatabaseManager:
    """Manages database connections with proper error handling."""

    def __init__(self, config: DatabaseConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self._connection: Optional[object] = None

    def connect(self) -> None:
        """Establish database connection with retry logic."""
        try:
            # Connection logic here
            self.logger.info("Database connection established")
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Failed to connect to database: {e}")
            raise

    @classmethod
    def from_environment(cls) -> 'DatabaseManager':
        """Create DatabaseManager from environment variables."""
        config = DatabaseConfig(
            host=os.environ.get('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
            port=int(os.environ.get('DB_PORT', '5432')),
            database=os.environ.get('DB_NAME', 'defaultdb'),
            username=os.environ.get('DB_USER', 'user'),
            password=os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD', '')
        )

        if not config.password:
            raise ValueError("DB_PASSWORD environment variable is required")

        return cls(config)
```
