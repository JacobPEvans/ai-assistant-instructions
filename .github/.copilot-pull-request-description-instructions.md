## Guidelines

### Description Section

- Start with the business value or problem being solved
- Explain technical approach and key decisions
- Mention any breaking changes or migration steps
- Include screenshots for UI changes

### Changes Made Section

- Focus on functional changes, not file-level details
- Group related changes together
- Highlight security or performance implications
- Note any configuration or deployment changes required

### Testing Instructions

- Provide step-by-step reproduction steps
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Specify any required test data or setup
- Document expected behavior vs actual behavior for bug fixes

### Cost Impact (Cloud Resources)

- Estimate monthly costs
- Compare costs to alternatives considered
- Consider cost optimization opportunities

## Example PR Descriptions

### Feature Addition

```markdown
## Description

Implements automated backup system for homelab services using Terraform and AWS S3.
This addresses the need for reliable, cost-effective backup storage with automated lifecycle management.

The solution uses S3 with Intelligent Tiering to optimize costs and includes encryption at rest with
customer-managed KMS keys for security compliance.

## Changes Made

- Added Terraform module for S3 backup bucket with versioning
- Implemented lifecycle policy for automatic archival after 30 days
- Created backup scripts for database and configuration files
- Added monitoring and alerting for backup failures
- Updated documentation with backup recovery procedures

## Testing Instructions

1. Deploy the Terraform configuration in a test environment
2. Run the backup script: `./scripts/backup-homelab.ps1`
3. Verify backup files appear in S3 console
4. Test restoration process: `./scripts/restore-backup.ps1 <backup-date>`
5. Confirm monitoring alerts work by simulating a backup failure

## Cost Impact

- Estimated monthly cost: $3.50
  - S3 storage: ~$2.00 for 100GB
  - KMS key: $1.00
  - Data transfer: ~$0.50
- Cost justified: Critical for data protection and compliance
- Alternative solutions (on-premise) would cost ~$200+ in hardware

## Related Issues

- Fixes #45 - Implement automated backup system
- Addresses #12 - Data protection compliance requirements

### Bug Fix

```markdown
## Description

Resolves authentication timeout issues when connecting to UniFi controller that were causing monitoring dashboard
to show stale data.

Root cause was insufficient HTTP timeout values and missing retry logic for transient network issues.

## Changes Made

- Increased HTTP client timeout from 5s to 30s
- Added exponential backoff retry mechanism (3 attempts)
- Improved error logging with detailed timeout information
- Added connection health check endpoint

## Testing Instructions

1. Simulate network latency: `tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 10s`
2. Run monitoring script: `python monitor-unifi.py`
3. Verify script completes successfully with retries logged
4. Remove network delay: `tc qdisc del dev eth0 root`
5. Confirm normal operation resumes

## Cost Impact

- No cost impact - configuration change only

## Related Issues

- Fixes #78 - UniFi monitoring dashboard shows stale data
- Related to #82 - Improve error handling across monitoring stack
