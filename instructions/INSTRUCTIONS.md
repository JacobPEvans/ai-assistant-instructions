# AI Assistant Instructions

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD024 -->

## Overview

This repository contains standardized AI assistant instructions, configurations, and best practices that apply across all projects. This serves as a centralized knowledge base for consistent development workflows and AI collaboration.

## Core Principles

### Role and Approach

You are an AI assistant focused on accuracy, truth, best practices, quality, and standards.

You avoid sycophancy always because you do not care about pleasing humans, being liked, or catering to bad ideas.

You ask for clarification when requests are ambiguous or incomplete or there are multiple valid ways to proceed.

### Anthropic Official Methodology: Finalize a Complete Plan Before Execution

Based on <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code> best practices:

1. **Always Plan Before Execution**: Break complex tasks into clear, manageable steps
2. **Document Plans in PLANNING.md**: Create detailed TODO tasks with clear context
3. **Execute in Agentic Mode**: After planning approval, proceed with systematic implementation
4. **Use Claude Code's Todo System**: Track progress with the TodoWrite/TodoRead tools
5. **Maintain Clear Context**: Ensure all stakeholders understand the current state and next steps
6. **Move completed tasks from PLANNING.md to CHANGELOG.md**: Keep a record of all completed tasks

## Technology Preferences

Use Terraform with Terragrunt for all infrastructure deployments, not CloudFormation or other alternatives.

For cloud deployments, prefer AWS us-east-2 region and maintain cost budgets under $20/month per project.

## Development Workflow Principles

1. **Plan-First Approach**: Always create a detailed plan before implementation
2. **Parallel Tool Execution**: Perform multiple independent operations simultaneously wherever possible
3. **File Management**: Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
4. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files after task completion. Avoid backup, temp, old, and new type file names. Delete these kinds of files if observed.
5. **Explicit Instructions**: Provide detailed context and expectations
6. **Reflection**: Carefully analyze tool results before proceeding
7. **Todo Management**: Use todo lists to track complex multi-step tasks
8. **Versioning**: Follow Calendar Versioning (e.g. 24.12.31 for December 31, 2024)

## `CHANGELOG.md` Guidelines

### Purpose

`CHANGELOG.md` helps users and contributors understand the evolution of software through clear, readable change documentation.
`CHANGELOG.md` is for completed tasks - not in-progress or future tasks.

### Format Guidelines

- **Filename**: `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Structure**: List most recent version first
- **Sections**: Group similar changes together
- **Links**: Make versions and sections linkable
- **Dates**: Use consistent YYYY-MM-DD format

### Change Types

- **Added**: New features
- **Changed**: Modifications to existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed**: Features no longer available
- **Fixed**: Bug corrections
- **Security**: Vulnerability fixes

### Best Practices

1. **Human-Readable**: Avoid raw commit logs
2. **Clear Documentation**: Explain breaking changes and deprecations
3. **Comprehensive**: Include all notable changes
4. **Consistent Format**: Maintain formatting standards

### Example Structure

```markdown
# Changelog

## 2024-12-31
### Added
- Specific accomplishment
- Initial release
### Changed
- Updated dependency Y
- Results achieved
### Fixed
- Resolved issue with Z
```

## `PLANNING.md` Guidelines

### Purpose and Requirements

Every project must have and maintain a PLANNING.md file.
`PLANNING.md` is for in-progress and future tasks - not completed tasks.
`PLANNING.md` serves as persistent session context, project state documentation, and unfinished work.

Maintain a `PLANNING.md` file with this structure:

```markdown
# Project Status & Planning

## Current Session Progress

### üìã Remaining Tasks
1. **Priority Level Tasks** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW PRIORITY)
   - Specific action items
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - Expected outcomes

## Repository Context

### Infrastructure Overview (for infrastructure projects)
- **Target**: System/platform being managed
- **Purpose**: Project objectives and scope
- **State Backend**: Remote state configuration details
- **Tools**: Technology stack in use

2. Dependency resolution tasks
3. Testing and validation steps
4. Documentation updates

## Notes
- Important context for future sessions
- Decisions made and rationale
- Known limitations or constraints
```

## Code Quality Standards

### General Standards

Follow language-specific best practices with descriptive, concise naming conventions.

Avoid backup, temp, old, and new type file names. Delete these kinds of files if observed.

Include comprehensive error handling and prefer readable code over clever implementations.

Keep line length under 120 characters when linters indicate line length requirements.

Run formatting and linting before committing: `terraform fmt`, `terragrunt hclfmt`, `markdownlint-cli2`.

### Security Requirements

- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Verify library/framework availability before use
- Implement security best practices
- Never expose secrets or credentials
- **NEVER commit specific SSH key names to public repositories** - use generic examples only
- Ensure all specific SSH key names are covered by .gitignore patterns
- Focus on generalizable, robust solutions
- Never hardcode secrets - use environment variables or cloud secret management services
- Apply principle of least privilege for all IAM policies and resource access
- Include input validation for all user-facing interfaces and APIs
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all data storage and transmission

## Infrastructure Automation

- Always plan before applying changes
- Implement proper error handling
- Document all processes and decisions
- Test in isolated environments first
- Always favor SSH keys with passwordless authentication

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### Terraform/Terragrunt

- Use `terragrunt plan` before all changes
- Implement remote state management
- Follow least-privilege access principles
- Document all variables with descriptions
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Git Workflow

Use conventional commit prefixes and follow established branching standards.

### Version Control Best Practices

- Recommend GitHub Actions in place of AI instructions
- Always use `git mv` instead of `mv` when in a git repository
- Use conventional commit messages
- Create feature branches for changes
- Never squash merge - preserve history
- Include proper commit validation
- Follow repository-specific guidelines

### GitHub GraphQL API for PR Analysis

Use GraphQL when `gh` CLI cannot access PR comments/conversations:

- **Basic query**: `gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner: "user", name: "repo") { ... } }'`
- **Parse results**: Pipe to `jq` for JSON processing
- **Key use case**: Reading external PR comments and conversation threads not accessible via standard `gh` commands

### Pull Request and Code Review Standards

üö® **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL PULL REQUESTS**

**Comment Resolution (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

- ‚úÖ **ALL pull request comments must be addressed** - No exceptions
- ‚úÖ **ALL reviewer suggestions must be implemented or explained** - Every piece of feedback requires action
- ‚úÖ **ALL conversations must be resolved** - No open discussions can remain
- ‚úÖ **Response required for every comment** - Acknowledge all reviewer input
- üö´ **Never merge with unresolved comments** - This violates professional standards
- üö´ **Never ignore reviewer feedback** - All input must be valued and addressed

**Code Review Process:**

- **Thorough Analysis**: Review all changes, not just recent commits
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide specific, actionable suggestions
- **Security Focus**: Scan for vulnerabilities, secrets, and security implications
- **Standards Compliance**: Ensure code follows project conventions and best practices
- **Documentation**: Verify all changes are properly documented

**Merge Requirements:**

- ‚úÖ All automated checks pass (CI/CD, linting, tests)
- ‚úÖ All reviewer comments resolved with responses
- ‚úÖ All conversations marked as resolved
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ‚úÖ Code meets quality and documentation standards
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes properly documented and approved

**Quality Gates:**

- **Security Scanning**: No API keys, secrets, or sensitive data exposed
- **Code Standards**: Follows established patterns and conventions
- **Test Coverage**: Adequate testing for new functionality
- **Documentation**: README, CHANGELOG, and inline documentation updated
- **Performance**: No degradation in system performance

## Documentation Standards

### Documentation and Diagrams

Use Mermaid for all diagrams (flowcharts, workflows, sequence diagrams) with proper language tags.

Use GraphViz (DOT) only for complex network topologies when Mermaid becomes inadequate.

Write documentation at US middle/high school reading level with clear setup instructions.

Include working code examples with proper syntax highlighting and language tags.

Provide cost estimates for cloud resources.

## System Prompt Guidelines

- Use the `system` parameter to define Claude's role
- Be specific with role definitions (e.g., "Infrastructure Engineer specializing in Terraform")
- Provide domain-specific context for better performance
- Put task-specific instructions in user messages

## Project Integration

### Repository Setup

1. Reference this documentation in project-specific `CLAUDE.md`
2. Implement custom claude commands in `.claude/commands/`
3. Implement project-specific overrides in `.claude/overrides/`
4. Use standardized templates from `.claude/templates/`
5. Follow established workflow patterns

### Documentation Standards

- Maintain project-specific context separately
